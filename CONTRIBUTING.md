# Submitting and requesting new icons
All icons should be submitted through the issues tab, not through pull requests. 

You're free to suggest that we make an icon as long as you provide an SVG source.
If you're providing icons you made yourself, keep them in the issue, and make sure
that you've made them from the base of another icon.
